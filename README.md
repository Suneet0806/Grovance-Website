## About

Grovance is a closed, campus-verified marketplace built exclusively for university students. Unlike unregulated WhatsApp groups or public marketplaces, Grovance allows only students with verified college email addresses to buy and sell items — eliminating scams and building a trusted peer-to-peer community.

**Target Users:**
- Freshmen who need affordable essentials (books, electronics, hostel items)
- Graduating students looking to sell or declutter before leaving campus
- Any student wanting to save money by buying second-hand from trusted peers

## How the AI Negotiation Works

1. Seller sets a **minimum acceptable price** when listing an item (private — never shown to buyers)
2. Buyer clicks **"Negotiate with AI"** on any product detail page
3. AI acts as the seller's representative — friendly but firm
4. AI will never go below the `min_price` set by the seller
5. When both sides agree, AI outputs `DEAL_AGREED:₹[price]`
6. A green banner appears with a **"Send to Seller on WhatsApp"** button
7. Seller receives the agreed price via WhatsApp and approves or declines

## How Smart Labels Work

Labels are computed automatically on every marketplace load — no manual tagging needed.

| Label | Condition | Color |
|---|---|---|
| 🆕 NEW | Posted within the last 24 hours | Green |
| 🔥 HOT | 10 or more views | Red |
| 💰 DEAL | Price is 40%+ below category average | Blue |
